# CPU Sscheduling Algorithms
1. First Come First Serve with arrival time
2. Shortest Job First - with arrival time
3. Round Robin Scheduling
4. Multilevel Queue Scheduling - 2 core or more <br>

**In each algorithm:**
- Throughput time
- Turnaround time
- Waiting time <br>

I used python without using any data structures methods - just list and tuple objects
