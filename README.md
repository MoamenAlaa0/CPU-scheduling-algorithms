# CPU Sscheduling Algorithms
- First Come First Serve with arrival time
- Shortest Job First - with arrival time
- Round Robin Scheduling
- Multilevel Queue Scheduling - 2 core or more 
<br>** In each algorithm: **
- Throughput time
- Turnaround time
- Waiting time
<br>I used python without using any data structures methods - just list and tuple objects
